        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>
          Hi! I’m <strong>Nina Heinemann</strong>, a senior at TCU majoring in Communication Studies
          with a minor in Digital Culture &amp; Data Analytics. I’m passionate about blending
          creativity, storytelling, and technology to create meaningful projects. This portfolio
          highlights my progress in <em>WRIT40363 – Intro to Web Applications</em>, where I’m learning
          how to build clean, accessible websites while practicing professional GitHub workflows.
          Beyond class, I enjoy exploring digital culture, event coordination, and design, and I
          hope to bring all of these skills together in my future career.

      <h2>Featured Work</h2>
      <p>
        I enjoy combining storytelling, design, and technology to create meaningful projects.
        In past roles, I’ve worked on event coordination and social media content creation. For example, I’ve helped plan professional events, managed
        marketing materials, and worked alongside creative teams to make sure every detail
        came together. I love capturing moments through photography and design and then
        sharing them in ways that connect with people. This mix of creativity and strategy
        is something I want to keep building on as I grow my career.

      <h2>Current Learning</h2>
      <p>
        Right now, I’m learning how to make websites that don’t just “work” but also look
        professional and feel easy to use. This course is teaching me about semantic HTML5,
        accessibility, and GitHub workflows—all things that go beyond the basics and push
        me toward thinking like a professional. I’ve realized that small details, like alt
        text for images or clear commit messages, make a big difference in building
        something that lasts. I’m excited to keep improving my coding confidence and to
        see how these skills will connect to my interests in communication, design, and
        digital culture.
