## 🤖 How AI Helped Me During This Project
Throughout Daily Fuel, I used AI to:
- Understand how to structure a multi-section app using one JS file  
- Fix issues in my calorie total calculations  
- Clean up my functions for saving goals and reflections  
- Add helpful code comments without making the file messy  
- Improve the wording of UI placeholders and instructions  
- Create a cleaner file organization and design strategy  
- Get ideas for the soft, minimal pink UI aesthetic  

AI didn’t write the project — it guided me and helped me debug and improve what I wrote.

## 📘 What I Learned Because of AI
Using AI helped me learn:
- Why state management matters in JavaScript  
- How to use localStorage correctly for multiple data types  
- How to refactor messy code into cleaner, reusable functions  
- How to approach debugging logically  
- How to think like a designer by focusing on flow, not just features

## ⚠️ When AI Slowed Me Down
- Sometimes the explanations were too generic  
- Occasionally I got CSS ideas that didn’t match my vision  
- I had to learn how to ask more specific questions to get the right answers  
- I realized the importance of understanding my own code instead of copying solutions

## 💡 What I Can Do That AI Cannot
- Design an interface based on my personal aesthetic  
- Understand how I want users to *feel* when using the app  
- Make choices about softness, tone, and emotional intention  
- Translate my own experiences with wellness into thoughtful features  
- Create a project that reflects my voice and goals  

AI can help me code, but it cannot replace my creativity or the emotional purpose behind my design.

## 🔮 How I Will Use AI Moving Forward
I will continue using AI to:
- Brainstorm ideas  
- Debug code  
- Learn new concepts  
- Improve writing in my UI text  
- Get unstuck faster when something breaks  

But I will rely on **my own reasoning** for the actual building, designing, and decision-making.
