## 🌸 Overview
Daily Fuel is a personal wellness and food-reflection web app designed to help users build healthier and more mindful habits. Instead of tracking food in a strict or obsessive way, this app focuses on gentle awareness: how meals make you feel, what goals matter to you, and how your day balances out.

This project was built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes four core widgets:  
1. **Meal Logger** – log what you ate, calories, and how it made you feel  
2. **Daily Goals** – set gentle daily goals instead of extreme ones  
3. **Day Summary** – automatically totals calories and compares them to your goal  
4. **Reflection Journal** – write about emotions, patterns, and wins for the day  

All data is saved using `localStorage` so entries remain even after refreshing.
