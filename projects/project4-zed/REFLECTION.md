## 🌸 Introduction
Daily Fuel is the project that challenged me the most this semester but also the one that made me grow the most. This class came during a very stressful season in my life — family problems, graduation decisions, and personal pressure — and somehow this project became a grounding space for me. It made me think about food, feelings, energy, and routines in a healthier and more compassionate way.

## 🧠 What I Built
I created a four-section application:
- Meal logger  
- Goal setter  
- Calorie summary  
- Emotional reflection journal  

The goal was not perfection, but awareness. I wanted this to feel gentle, not strict. Every part of the UI, from the soft colors to the wording, reflects that intention.

## 💻 What I Learned While Building It
- How to save and manage structured data in localStorage  
- How to connect multiple widgets in one JS file  
- How to update the UI instantly when the user interacts  
- How to design something soft, minimal, and emotionally comforting  
- How to debug without panicking  
- How to build a project from scratch and actually understand it  

This was the first time I truly felt like a developer — not because everything worked on the first try, but because I kept going when it didn’t.

## 🤖 How AI Supported Me
AI helped me:
- Fix bugs that I couldn’t find on my own  
- Add helpful comments to my code  
- Understand event listeners and how to update UI in real time  
- Improve phrasing of instructions to make the app kinder  
- Stay organized when I felt overwhelmed  

But I still wrote the logic, built the structure, and made the creative decisions.

## 🧩 What AI Could Not Do
- Capture the emotional purpose behind the app  
- Design my soothing color palette  
- Understand why this project mattered to me personally  
- Replace the confidence I gained from solving my own problems  

AI *helped me learn*, but it did not — and could not — learn for me.

## ❤️ Personal Meaning
This project means a lot to me.  
It reflects how much I’ve grown — not just in coding, but in trusting myself.

Even though this semester was heavy, I still showed up, worked hard, and built something meaningful. My mom has always wanted me to learn web development, and now I have something real to show her. I know she will be proud of how far I’ve come and how much effort I put into this class.

## 🌟 Final Thoughts
Daily Fuel is not just a project.  
It’s proof that I didn’t give up.  
It’s proof that I learned to solve problems even when life was overwhelming.  
It’s proof that I can create something beautiful and functional with my own hands.

I am genuinely proud of what I built.
