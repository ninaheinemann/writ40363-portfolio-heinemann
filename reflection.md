# Week 2 Reflection — WRIT40363

**Confidence Check**  
I feel more confident with semantic HTML structure and how to use `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`. Headings make sense now, but I still have to remind myself about hierarchy.

**Learning Curve (Git & GitHub)**  
GitHub Desktop made version control easier than I expected. The biggest surprise is how helpful small, clear commits are for tracking my progress.

**Problem-Solving Growth**  
When something didn’t work, I slowed down and checked examples or validated my HTML. I caught mistakes like unclosed tags faster this week.

**Professional Mindset**  
It feels different moving from “just making a page” to building something professional. Writing good commit messages makes me feel more like a developer.

**Week 2 Aha Moment**  
I realized semantic HTML isn’t just rules—it helps people and tools understand my page better. That clicked for me this week.

**Looking Forward**  
I’m excited (and nervous) about learning CSS layouts and making pages responsive. I want my pages to look clean but not overcomplicated.

**Support and Resources**  
Class demos and the HTML validator helped the most. Hands-on practice has been key, and I’ll keep using those resources.
