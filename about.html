      <p>
        I’m passionate about marketing, digital design, and data analytics — and I enjoy finding ways to bring these skills together. My experience includes managing social media, developing branding concepts, exploring web design, and using data to shape creative strategies.

    <section class="about section">
      <h2 class="section-label">goals</h2>
      <p>
        My long-term goal is to lead a marketing department and eventually establish my own business, where I can combine creativity, strategy, and leadership skills. Outside of work and academics, I enjoy photography, interior design, pilates, and tennis. I also value time with friends and family, which keeps me grounded and inspired.
